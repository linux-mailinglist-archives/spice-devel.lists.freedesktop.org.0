I am using spice-vdagent on most of my qemu-kvm vm's, while this is very c=
onvenient, mouse button 8 and 9 are not working (those are the side buttons=
 of the mouse, one is often used for BACK function of the browser, which my=
 thumb is actually addicted to).

How could i make these buttons work with spice-vdagent?



Thanks for the suggestions,



Bruts
