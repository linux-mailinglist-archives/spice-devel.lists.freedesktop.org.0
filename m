Hi,

thank you very much for your reply. Of course I understand that 
non-compiling/crashing code should not be merged into main.
Unfortunately I have not been able to reproduce this so far. Here's a 
list of the systems I have tested on:

- Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS
   AMD EPYC 7742
   Intel Flex 140 with SR-IOV passthrough and without passthrough

- CentOS Stream 9
   AMD EPYC 7742
   Intel Flex 170 (SR-IOV)

- Ubuntu 22.04
   8th Gen Intel with GVT-g and without passthrough

- Fedora 39
   12th Gen Intel (SR-IOV)

Do you have an example system on which it does not compile/crash or what 
the error messages are? Then I could possibly reproduce it and 
contribute to a fix.

Greetings,
Michael
