I tested this patchset with several configurations:

- With a passthrough intel gvt-g virtual gpu it works.

- With virtio-vga it works.

- With some extra patches to qemu and an virtualization driver it even 
works with an virtual GPU from an SR-IOV-partitioned Intel Flex
140 GPU. Note this extra patches are related to the gpu and not this 
patchset.

This patch is a significant improvement for handling graphically 
demanding tasks or rapidly changing image content and is crucial for 
SPICE to be a component of a competitive virtual desktop infrastructure.
